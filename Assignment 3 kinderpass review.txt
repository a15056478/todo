1. KinderPass has great UI but, It takes time to fetch and display previous day's data, For that a good State management is required.
2. Could not find out how to remove bookmarked articles.
3. I we could track the activities of the user that would definitly help in future.
4. We can use alarm reminder instead of just showing notifications.
